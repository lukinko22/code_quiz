# Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Your Task
 

In this weekâ€™s challenge I am to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
